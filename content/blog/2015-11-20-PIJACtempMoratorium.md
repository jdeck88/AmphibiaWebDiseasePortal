The Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC) has recommended that all importers, exporters
and buyers place a voluntary temporary moratorium on firebelly and paddletail newts 
(_Cynops orientalis_ and _Pachytriton labiatus_*, respectively) to thwart the spread of _Bsal_ to US
salamander populations. They also ask all businesses to regularly sanitize their facilities 
as a precautionary measure while government agencies, industry, and researchers work towards 
effective _Bsal_ testing and treatment protocols.

*AmphibiaWeb notes that [_Pachytriton labiatus_](http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-scientific_name=Pachytriton+granulosus) is now being recognized as _Pachytriton granulosus_.
